## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to analyze global CO2 emissions on a per capita basis. By focusing on emissions normalized to population size, we aim to uncover trends and patterns across countries, regions, and income groups. This will allow us to identify key contributors to emissions, track progress over time, and assess the fairness and effectiveness of climate policies.

## Setup and Installation
git clone https://github.com/your-username/adsc_3910_group_5.git
