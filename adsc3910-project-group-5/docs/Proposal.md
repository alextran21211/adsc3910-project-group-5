### Introduction

The rapid rise in global CO2 emissions due to fossil fuel consumption has become one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. As greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide continue to accumulate in the atmosphere, they contribute to global warming, causing widespread climate change that affects ecosystems, weather patterns, and human health. Understanding the trends in CO2 emissions across different countries and their respective energy sources is critical for shaping effective policies to mitigate climate impacts. Therefore, our primary question is: **How can we better understand the trends and sources of CO2 emissions globally, and which countries or sources are contributing the most to this issue?**

To address this problem, we will leverage data on fossil CO2 emissions across multiple countries from 2002 to 2022. By analyzing how emissions from different sources—such as coal, oil, gas, cement, and flaring—have changed over time, we can identify trends, investigate the impact of different energy sources, and determine per capita emissions, which help in assessing the relative contribution of each country.

The goal of this project is to develop data-driven insights that can inform policy-makers, environmentalists, and businesses on emission reduction strategies. To achieve this, we will refine the problem into several tangible objectives:
1. **Explore and visualize emission trends** across countries and time to identify key patterns.
2. **Analyze the impact of various emission sources** on total CO2 output, identifying which energy sources are the most critical drivers of emissions.
3. **Predict future emissions** using historical data, offering foresight into potential challenges and opportunities for intervention.

The final data product will include:
- **A data pipeline** that processes and cleans the emissions data, ensuring it is ready for analysis.
- **A set of visualizations and statistical models** that provide insights into the trends and drivers of CO2 emissions.
- **A dashboard** summarizing key metrics, trends, and predictions, allowing for easy interpretation by non-technical stakeholders.

Through these techniques, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of global CO2 emissions and inform actionable strategies to reduce the human impact on climate change.

### 2 Data Science Techniques:
2.1 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    1. **Data Visualization:**
    Use visualizations to uncover patterns in CO2 emissions over time. Techniques such as:
        1. Line plots to show the trends of CO2 emissions (total and by category) for individual countries.
        2. Heatmaps to display the emissions per capita across different countries.
        3. Bar charts for comparing emissions between countries.
        4. Correlations: Investigate how different emission sources (coal, oil, etc.) correlate with total emissions or per capita emissions. This helps determine which energy sources are most responsible for the rise in emissions.
    2. **Regression Models:** 
        1. Linear Regression can help understand the relationship between population (external dataset), GDP, and emissions. We predict total CO2 emissions based on energy source contributions, or CO2 per capita as a function of economic indicators.
        2. Multivariate Regression: Use multiple independent variables (coal, oil, gas, etc.) to predict total emissions and analyze which sources are most impactful.

3. **Data Suitability & Potential Challenges**
3.1 Suitability:
The dataset is appropriate for regression models given the continuous variables (emissions, per capita emissions) and multiple independent features (coal, oil, gas, etc.).

3.2 Challenges:
Missing Data: Emissions data may be missing for certain countries or years. This could necessitate imputation techniques or careful analysis of missingness patterns.
Skewed Data: Emissions data might be heavily skewed, with a few countries contributing disproportionately (e.g., the USA, China). Techniques like log transformation might help normalize the data for analysis.
Multicollinearity: Some of the emissions variables (coal, oil, gas) might be highly correlated. This can be a challenge for regression models, where multicollinearity can distort results.
