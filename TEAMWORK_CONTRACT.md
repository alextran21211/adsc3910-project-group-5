## Team Members

2. **Manisha K**
3. **Huynh Hiep Tran (preferred name: Alex Tran)**

## Expectations
- The time expected for group members to meet and discuss the project will be at least 4 hours per week (including meetings), unless all team members agree to extend this time.
- The time expected for any member to work on individual tasks for this project will be at least 5 hours per week, unless all team members agree to extend this time.
- Each group member should complete their assigned tasks well in advance of the deliverable submission deadline to ensure there is sufficient time for reviewing pull requests before submission.
- If team members are unable to complete their tasks within the allocated weekly hours, they should inform the team via WhatsApp ahead of the deadline to discuss whether work needs to be redistributed or if additional time is required.
- All submissions are expected to meet the criteria set out in the deliverable instructions.

## Mode of Communication
- Team members will have in-person meetings at the Olara building on Tuesday, 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM. These meetings will be used for brainstorming, planning deliverables for the week,reviewing the progress of tasks and distributing tasks among members.
- Online meetings will be held via Google Meets on Friday between 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM.
- Communication outside of meetings will be through WhatsApp for informal communication and scheduling.

## Task Management System
- GitHub will be the primary tool for managing ideas, suggestions, submitting work, and reviewing work. A project board will be set up in GitHub to track tasks assigned to each person related to the deliverables. Tasks will be closed after the corresponding deliverable is completed.

## Reviews
- All members are expected to create a new sub-branch from the main branch and submit a pull request to merge their work into the GitHub repository for the group project. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to ensure all pull requests are reviewed by another team member.

## Breach of Contract
- Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:
  1. The first step is a written WhatsApp notice outlining the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the contract conditions.
  2. The second step is a meeting to discuss the behavior and write an agreement to follow the team contract, which is required by the member.
  3. The third step involves reaching out to the mentor about the issues with the teammate.
